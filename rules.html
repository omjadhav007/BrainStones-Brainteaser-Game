    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li>The game consists of 10 boxes, with 5 boxes located on each player's side.
            </li>
            <li>Initially, each of the 10 boxes contains 6 stones, totaling 60 stones in the entire game setup.
            </li>
            <li>During a player's turn, they have the option to pick up stones from any box on their side of the board.
            </li>
            <li>After picking up stones, the player must select either the left or right direction and start placing one
                stone at a time in consecutive boxes in that chosen direction.
            </li>
            <li>If the picked-up stones are depleted and the box next to the last placed stone is empty, the number of
                stones in the following box is added to the scoring player's score.
            </li>
            <li>If the picked-up stones are exhausted and the box adjacent to the last placed stone is not empty, the
                player must collect stones from that box and repeat the placing process.
            </li>
            <li>If, during the game, any box contains 4 stones, that box becomes empty, and the player to whom the box
                belongs has their score increased by 4.
            </li>
            <li>The game concludes when all the boxes are empty.
            </li>
            <li>The player with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner.</li>
